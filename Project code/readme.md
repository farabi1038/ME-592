Before working on this you need to set up 3 repositories training process.Make sure that this 3 repositories standalone.
Here are the 3 repositories. 
1. DeepLabV3: https://github.com/leimao/DeepLab-V3
2. YolaAct: https://github.com/dbolya/yolact
3. Nvdia semantic semmentation: https://github.com/NVIDIA/semantic-segmentation
Once you are done with setting up all this 3 repositories you need to set up Boston Street calssifiers (https://github.com/ddehueck/BostonStreetCaster/tree/master/ml_models/segment_images/standard) which is using DeepLabV3. Once you are done with all these fours, then it is easy to go forward from here.
